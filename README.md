## 📚 Introduction
Welcome to the DVD Rental Database Project, a hands-on application of PostgreSQL, the powerful open-source object-relational database system. 🎓

This project encapsulates 15 meticulously designed tables: 'actor', 'film', 'film_actor', 'category', 'film_category', 'store', 'inventory', 'rental', 'payment', 'staff', 'customer', 'address', 'city', and 'country'. Each table represents various facets of a real-world DVD rental business. 📊

As you navigate through this project, you'll gain practical insights into the capabilities of PostgreSQL, refine your database management skills, and understand complex data structures and relationships. Welcome to a learning journey that unravels the intricate operations of a DVD rental store. 🚀
